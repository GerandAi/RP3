This folder contains a standard LaTeX document that can be used in Overleaf.
To use in Overleaf, the bristolLogo.png file will also need to be uploaded.

Be sure to set both the title and author for the document to have it reflected
properly on all pages.

There is also a BibTeX file (references.bib), giving an example of BibTex
usage. This hopefully works with most LaTeX editors. Commands for building
the document can be parsed from the Makefile. If you don't know what a Makefile
is, feel free to ignore it.
