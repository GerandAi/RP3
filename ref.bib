   abstract = {Several recently proposed stochastic optimization methods that have been successfully used in training deep networks such as RMSPROP, ADAM, ADADELTA, NADAM are based on using gradient updates scaled by square roots of exponential moving averages of squared past gradients. In many applications, e.g. learning with large output spaces, it has been empirically observed that these algorithms fail to converge to an optimal solution (or a critical point in nonconvex settings). We show that one cause for such failures is the exponential moving average used in the algorithms. We provide an explicit example of a simple convex optimization setting where ADAM does not converge to the optimal solution, and describe the precise problems with the previous analysis of ADAM algorithm. Our analysis suggests that the convergence issues can be fixed by endowing such algorithms with “long-term memory” of past gradients, and propose new variants of the ADAM algorithm which not only fix the convergence issues but often also lead to improved empirical performance.},

   abstract = {We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

   abstract = {As in the first and second editions, the book revolves around the fact that turbulence modeling is one of three key elements in CFD. Very precise mathematical theories have evolved for the other two, viz., grid generation and algorithm development. By its nature, i.e., creating a mathematical model that approximates the physical behavior of turbulent flows, far less precision has been achieved in turbulence modeling. This text addresses the problem of selecting/devising such models. The fundamental premise is, in the spirit of G. I. Taylor, an ideal model should introduce the minimum amount of complexity while capturing the essence of the relevant physics. The text begins with the simplest models and charts a course leading to some of the most complex models that have been applied to a nontrivial flow. Along the way, a systematic methodology is presented for developing and analyzing turbulence models. The methodology makes use of tensor calculus, similarity solutions, singular perturbation methods, and numerical procedures. The text stresses the need to achieve a balance amongst the physics of turbulence, mathematical tools required to solve turbulence-model equations, and common numerical problems attending their use (i.e., what good is a model if it makes your program crash?). Several user friendly programs and detailed user's guides are provided on the Compact Disk that accompanies the text. Many of the applications are used throughout the text to permit comparison of complicated models with simpler models. A completely objective point of view is taken in assessing the merits of models and their range of applicability. The text includes an extensive Bibliography, a detailed Index and well thought out homework problems of varying degrees of difficulty.},

   abstract = {A surrogate modeling strategy, using effective interpolation and sampling methods, facilitates a reduction in the number of computational fluid dynamics simulations required to construct an aerodynamic model to a specified accuracy. In this paper, two adaptive sampling strategies are compared for generating surrogate models, based on Kriging and radial basis function interpolation, respectively. The relationships between the two model formulations are discussed, and three test cases are considered, including analytic functions and recovery of aerodynamic coefficients for two example applications: longitudinal flight mechanics analysis for the DLR-F12 aircraft and structural loads analysis of an RAE2822 airfoil. For the airfoil example, models of C L, CD, and CM were constructed with the two sampling strategies using Euler/boundary-layer-coupled computational fluid dynamics and a three- dimensional flight envelope of incidence, Mach, and Reynolds number. The two sampling approaches direct some samples toward exploration of the domain by minimizing model uncertainty and some toward refinement of local nonlinearities, by adapting to model curvature or extrema. The results provide some evidence that, for certain functions, incertainscenarios, each update scheme could be useful.Both methods were atleast better than traditional space-filling sampling for all the test cases presented. © 2012 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

This paper presents a provably convergent trust-region model-management methodology for variable-parameterization design models: that is, models for which the design parameters are defined over different spaces. Corrected space mapping is introduced as a method to map between the variable-parameterization design spaces. It is then used with a sequential-quadratic-programming-like trust-region method for two aerospace-related design optimization problems. Results for a wing design problem and a flapping-flight problem show that the method outperforms direct optimization in the high-fidelity space. On the wing design problem, the new method achieves 76% savings in high-fidelity function calls. On a bat-flight design problem, it achieves approximately 45% time savings, although it converges to a different local minimum than did the benchmark.},

They provide a global model of some metric of a design (such as weight, aerodynamic drag, cost, etc.), which can then be optimized efficiently. Engineering Design via Surrogate Modelling is a self-contained guide to surrogate models and their use in engineering design. The fundamentals of building, selecting, validating, searching and refining a surrogate are presented in a manner accessible to novices in the field. Figures are used liberally to explain the key concepts and clearly show the differences between the various techniques, as well as to emphasize the intuitive nature of the conceptual and mathematical reasoning behind them. More advanced and recent concepts are each presented in stand-alone chapters, allowing the reader to concentrate on material pertinent to their current design problem, and concepts are clearly demonstrated using simple design problems. This collection of advanced concepts (visualization, constraint handling, coping with noisy data, gradient-enhanced modelling, multi-fidelity analysis and multiple objectives) represents an invaluable reference manual for engineers and researchers active in the area. Engineering Design via Surrogate Modelling is complemented by a suite of Matlab codes, allowing the reader to apply all the techniques presented to their own design problems. By applying statistical modelling to engineering design, this book bridges the wide gap between the engineering and statistics communities. It will appeal to postgraduates and researchers across the academic engineering design community as well as practising design engineers.},

This is the question addressed in this paper, namely, the extent to which the use of metamodeling techniques in multidisciplinary design optimization have evolved in the 25 years since the seminal paper on design and analysis of computer experiments by Sacks et al. ("Design and Analysis of Computer Experiments," Statistical Science, Vol. 4, No. 4, 1989, pp. 409-435). Rather than a technical review of the entire body of metamodeling literature, the focus is on the evolution and motivation for advancements in metamodeling with some discussion on the research itself; not surprisingly, much of the current research motivation is the same as it was in the past. Based on current research thrusts in the field, multifidelity approximations and ensembles (i.e., sets) of metamodels, as well as the availability of metamodels within commercial software, are emphasized. Design space exploration and visualization via metamodels are also presented as they rely heavily on metamodels for rapid design evaluations during exploration. The closing remarks offer insight into future research directions, mostly motivated by the need for new capabilities and the ability to handle more complex simulations. © 2013 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

Particular design issues in tiltrotors produce wings that are thick and highly loaded, and so separation and early-onset buffet can be problematic, and vortex generators are commonly used to alleviate these issues. In this work, the design of vortex generators for the elimination of separation is considered using a viscous flowfield simulation.Alarge design space of rectangular vane-type vortex generators is sampled and simulated, and a radial-basis-function surrogate model is implemented to model the full design space. An efficient adaptive sampling approach for improved design space sampling has also been developed that balances the properties of space filling, curvature capture, and optimum locating. This approach has been tested on the design of a vortex generator on a highly loaded infinite wing, with a representative tiltrotor airfoil section, using a five-dimensional design space. The design of the vortex generators using this approach shows that elimination of the separation is possible while simultaneously reducing the drag of the wing with optimized vortex generators, compared to the clean wing.},

   abstract = {Turbulence modeling is a critical component in numerical simulations of industrial flows based on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations. However, after decades of efforts in the turbulence modeling community, universally applicable RANS models with predictive capabilities are still lacking. Large discrepancies in the RANS-modeled Reynolds stresses are the main source that limits the predictive accuracy of RANS models. Identifying these discrepancies is of significance to possibly improve the RANS modeling. In this work, we propose a data-driven, physics-informed machine learning approach for reconstructing discrepancies in RANS modeled Reynolds stresses. The discrepancies are formulated as functions of the mean flow features. By using a modern machine learning technique based on random forests, the discrepancy functions are trained by existing direct numerical simulation (DNS) databases and then used to predict Reynolds stress discrepancies in different flows where data are not available. The proposed method is evaluated by two classes of flows: (1) fully developed turbulent flows in a square duct at various Reynolds numbers and (2) flows with massive separations. In separated flows, two training flow scenarios of increasing difficulties are considered: (1) the flow in the same periodic hills geometry yet at a lower Reynolds number and (2) the flow in a different hill geometry with a similar recirculation zone. Excellent predictive performances were observed in both scenarios, demonstrating the merits of the proposed method.},

Localized heating due to penetrations or other singularities on the aeroshell must also be taken into account.

This paper presents a method of using deep neural networks to learn a model for the Reynolds stress anisotropy tensor from high-fidelity simulation data. A novel neural network architecture is proposed which uses a multiplicative layer with an invariant tensor basis to embed Galilean invariance into the predicted anisotropy tensor. It is demonstrated that this neural network architecture provides improved prediction accuracy compared with a generic neural network architecture that does not embed this invariance property. The Reynolds stress anisotropy predictions of this invariant neural network are propagated through to the velocity field for two test cases. For both test cases, significant improvement versus baseline RANS linear eddy viscosity and nonlinear eddy viscosity models is demonstrated.</p>},

In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently.

We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

   abstract = {A method of accurately calculating transonic and low Reynolds number airfoil flows, implemented in the viscous-inviscid design/analysis code ISES, is presented. The Euler equations are discretized on a conservative streamline grid and are strongly coupled to a two-equation integral boundary-layer formulation, using the displacement thickness concept. A transition prediction formulation of the e9 type is derived and incorporated into the viscous formulation. The entire discrete equation set, including the viscous and transition formulations, is solved as a fully coupled nonlinear system by a global Newton method. This is a rapid and reliable method for dealing with strong viscous-inviscid interactions, which invariably occur in transonic and low Reynolds number airfoil flows. The results presented demonstrate the ability of the ISES code to predict transitioning separation bubbles and their associated losses. The rapid airfoil performance degradation with decreasing Reynolds number is thus accurately predicted. Also presented is a transonic airfoil calculation involving shock-induced separation, showing the robustness of the global Newton solution procedure. Good agreement with experiment is obtained, further demonstrating the performance of the present integral boundary-layer formulation. © 1987 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc., All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {A comprehensive review of aerofoil shape parameterization methods that can be used for aerodynamic shape optimization is presented. Seven parameterization methods are considered for a range of design variables: class-shape transformations; B-splines; Hicks-Henne bump functions; a radial basis function domain element approach; Bèzier surfaces; a singular-value decomposition modal extraction method; and the parameterized sections method. Because of the large range of variables involved, the most effective way to implement each method is first investigated. Their performances are then analyzed by considering the geometric shape recovery of over 2000 aerofoils using a range of design variables, testing the efficiency of design space coverage with respect to a given tolerance. It is shown that, for all the methods, between 20 and 25 design variables are needed to cover the full design space to within a geometric tolerance, with the singular-value decomposition method doing this most efficiently. A set of transonic aerofoil case studies are also presented, with geometric error and convergence of the resulting aerodynamic properties explored. These results show a strong relationship between geometric error and aerodynamic convergence and demonstrate that between 38 and 66 design variables may be needed to ensure aerodynamic convergence to within one drag and one lift count.},

   abstract = {The numerical analysis of aerodynamic components based on the Reynolds?averaged Navier?Stokes equations has become critical for the design of transport aircraft but still entails large computational cost. Simulating a multitude of different flow conditions with high-fidelity methods as required for loads analysis or aerodynamic shape optimization is still prohibitive. Within the past few years, the application of machine learning methods has been proposed as a potential way to overcome these shortcomings. This is leading toward a new data-driven paradigm for the modeling of physical problems. The objective of this paper is the development of a deep-learning methodology for the prediction of aircraft surface pressure distributions and the rigorous comparison with existing state-of-the-art nonintrusive reduced-order models. Bayesian optimization techniques are employed to efficiently determine optimal hyperparameters for all deep neural networks. Three data-driven methods which are Gaussian processes, proper orthogonal decomposition combined with an interpolation technique, and deep learning are investigated. The results are compared for a two-dimensional airfoil case and the NASA Common Research Model transport aircraft as a relevant three-dimensional case. Results show that all methods are able to properly predict the surface pressure distribution at subsonic conditions. In transonic flow, when shock waves and separation lead to nonlinearities, deep-learning methods outperform the others by also capturing the shock wave location and strength accurately.},

   abstract = {In the aerodynamic design, optimization of the pressure distribution of airfoils is crucial for the aerodynamic components. Conventionally, the pressure distribution is solved by computational fluid dynamics, which is a time-consuming task. Surrogate modeling can leverage such expense to some extent, but it needs careful shape parameterization schemes for airfoils. As an alternative, deep learning approximates inputs-outputs mapping without solving the efficiency-expensive physical equations and avoids the limitations of particular parameterization methods. Therefore, this paper presents a data-driven approach for predicting the pressure distribution over airfoils based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Given the airfoil geometry, a supervised learning problem is presented for predicting aerodynamic performance. Furthermore, we utilize a universal and flexible parametrization method called Signed Distance Function to improve the performances of CNN. Given the unseen airfoils from the validation dataset to the trained model, our model achieves predicting the pressure coefficient in seconds, with a less than 2% mean square error.},
